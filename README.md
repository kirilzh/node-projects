>Note taking application.

>__To download dependencies:__ `npm install`

>__To run go to:__ /notes-node - `node app.js [args] [optional flags]`

>Where `[args]` defines what action you want to do. You can choose between add, list, read, and remove. You can use `[optional flags]` with add, read, and remove. Every note has a title and body. For example, to add a note `node app.js add --title="My Title" --body="Important body"`. To remove and read a note you have to only specify the title. `list` argument will list all notes.
